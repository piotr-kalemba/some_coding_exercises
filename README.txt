The repository contains a few python scripts containing some code that can be treated as
coding exercises.

The file reverse_polish_notation.py provides functions for verifying whether an arithmetic expression in
Reverse Polish Notation (rpn) is well-formed, whether an arithmeticexpression in Natural Notation (nn) is well-formed, functions for converting
well-formed expressions from rpn to nn and vice versa and, finally, functions for computing values of well-formed expressions in rpn or 
nn. All the algorithms used for the implementation of the functions are based on the use of stacks.
The file tests.py contains relevant unittests evidencing correctness of the functions mentioned above.

The file permutation_class.py contains a class for the representation of permutations. Methods implemented there allow
one to inverse and compose permutations and, moreover, to obtain the canonical cycle notation of a permutation. The file
permutations.py contains a function generating all the permutations of a given list of items.
